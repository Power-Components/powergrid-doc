# Bulk Actions

A Bulk Action is an efficient way to perform actions on one or more selected rows at the same time.

To illustrate, imagine you that you need to select several "dishes" and mark them as "Sold-out".

## Usage

To implement Bulk Actions in PowerGrid, you must add an `Action Button` inside the `header()` method. When clicked, this button will emit an event which will be handled as needed, for example by another component. See the code below:

```php
<?php

//...

    public function header(): array
    {
        return [
            Button::add('bulk-sold-out')
                ->caption(__('Mark as Sold-out'))
                ->class('cursor-pointer block bg-indigo-500 text-white')
                ->emit('bulkSoldOutEvent', [])
        ];
    }
```

Next, you must make PowerGrid aware of your new custom event `bulkSoldOutEvent`. To do so, add it in the `getListeners()` method as shown in the code below:

```php
<?php

//...
    protected function getListeners()
    {
        return array_merge(
            parent::getListeners(), [
                'eventX',
                'eventY',
                'bulkSoldOutEvent',
            ]);
    }
```

Following that, you must handle your event `bulkSoldOutEvent` in its own method. At this point, you could integrate another component, such as a modal confirmation.

The example below will trigger a Browser alert:

```php
<?php

//...

    public function bulkActionEvent(): void
    {
        if (count($this->checkboxValues) == 0) {
            $this->dispatchBrowserEvent('showAlert', ['message' => 'You must select at least one item!']);

            return;
        }

        $ids = implode(', ', $this->checkboxValues);

        $this->dispatchBrowserEvent('showAlert', ['message' => 'You have selected IDs: ' . $ids]);
    }
```

Finally, for this example to work, you must listen for the `showAlert` in the blade file which renders your table (e.g, `dishes.blade.php`):

```php
//...
        <!-- Scripts -->
        @livewireScripts
        @powerGridScripts
        <script src="//unpkg.com/alpinejs" defer></script>
        <script>
            window.addEventListener('showAlert', event => {
                alert(event.detail.message);
            })
        </script>

```

Now, you can select some rows and when you click on "Mark as Sold-out" button, an alert should appear with the IDs you have selected.
